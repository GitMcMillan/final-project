Welcome to my Game of Thrones character selection app. 
This project is a simple tool to compile, list, and view a few details from characters of the popular HBO program Game of Thrones. On page load, users will be introduced to a central image and some details of one of the shows main characters, Daenerys Targaryen. Her name,  title, and family house will be displayed in text for all to see, as well as the banner of her house family. Below her image will be pictures of other members of the same house. These pictures are styled in a way that will enlarge them upon mouseover, give the image an eye-pleasing background effect, and display the name of the character in floating text. If the user wants to see the details of that character, they need only to click on the image itself, and the details will render in the center of the page.

Users will imemediately notice a dropdown form on the right of the screen. This dropdown will hold the names of every character in the Game of Thrones character database. Users can simply select their favorite character and then the image, details, house banner and other house members will take the place of the currently rendered character. Thank you for using the app and always remember, winter is coming.
